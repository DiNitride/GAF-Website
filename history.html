        <h3><a name="chapter1">Before Records Began</a></h3>

        <p>
            It began when a group of friends created a Skype group called “The Congregation” in order to be able to play games together online. It remained this tight knit group for a few months before expansions began. DiNitride and WeeGee (now Sick Joke) met a guy called Michael in a game of CS:GO (Video Found Here) who then began introducing the group to other people; a guy called Magnus for example. Another Skype group, “meme.africa”, was then created to host these new people within their community. However these two groups co-existed and didn’t really communicate with each other and this continued for another few months; in this time Gol D. Roger and BestJames joined meme.africa.

            Everything changed when the groups got frustrated with the quality of Skype and it even went down for a day - so they decided to use TeamSpeak temporarily. This wasn’t popular with the group and CynicalGrape found an alternative called Discord, on which he created a server called “The Congregation” again and this, again, did not include meme.africa. In an attempt to bring the two groups together DiNitrite created a server for both of the groups together. This ultimately ended up with the beginnings of GAF as the two groups mixed together properly for the first time. A few months pass and then DiNitride, acting on a decision the whole group wanted, created a formal group which was named “Gaben and Frustration” by the suggestion of TacitcalBryan. This name wasn’t really very popular but no-one could think of a better name so it remained like this for a few months. During this time Chemy joined the server after meeting the group in a deathmatch server.

        <h3><a name="chapter2">The Beginning of GAF</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            Eventually the group settled on the name “GAF” - mostly because no one could think of anything better. It stuck; despite having no meaning behind it at all and being unrelated to the group completely. A decision was made that the meaning would change in every game so many autistic acrostic phrases could be made (for example “Gay American Forces”). This lead to a never ending stream of potential meanings for GAF and resulted in a server being founded called “The Never Ending GAF”, on the 22nd of January 2016, by DiNitride. This was the start of the official group and after this point the community began to grow steadily - Mr Bird Jesus and Kozicki joining soon after.

            New members began joining, most notably Black Mesa and GODOFRETARDS but also in this period the first member of GAF left the server. Michael, one of the original members from meme.africa, wasn’t interacting well with other people in the server and subsequently decided to leave the group on the 14th of March 2016. 

            At this point with the rise in new members, a more official way of introducing new GAF members was outlined. Initially, official GAF membership was as easy to achieve as it could be gained by remaining in the server for a very brief time and so different hierarchal roles were created to separate the long-term members (“GAF Members”) from the newer visitors (known as “Community Members”). This made it significantly more notable when a member was ‘promoted’ to GAF Member status. The next two members enlisted into GAF were Velorake and Zidaref on the 23rd of April 2016.

        <h3><a name="chapter3">The GAF Reform</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            On some date between the last paragraph and this one GAF had a small reform which involved a change in Discord server to a one nearly the same, tighter rules for gaining access to GAF and DiNitride wrote a discord bot for the server.

            A second server, “The Bone Xone”, was created for hentai which was unwanted in the main GAF chat but a ‘fetish’ of one of the existing members. This lead #VivaLaHentai being spammed in the main GAF chat and this new server; it quickly got out of hand and created a lot of tension in the community. This was finally resolved when Magnus left GAF.
            Shortly after GODOFRETARDS was also banned from the server because he broke server rules.

             Despite having left GAF Michael and a few members remained active on the BoneXone but didn’t interact with the main discord. That was until Magnus and Michael came onto the main discord and spammed an excess of 1000 messages of gore and disgusting images. Finally they were banned and all contact with those members was cut off.

            On the 21/5/2016, Pawelostr joined the forces of GAF, may his Polish soul bless us.

             After meeting a girl called Olive on Gmod some more drama occurred within the server when a GAF Member, Hu Juan McGregor, organised to meet her without other members of the group which upset a few people. This, alongside other events which resulted in a lot of anger and people being extremely pissed off ended with him being banned from GAF and entirely op dis-owned as a friend by some members. The third to be banned from membership. Later, on the 1st of June 2016, Olive was promoted to GAF because everybody wanted to rim her - the first girl to ‘officially’ gain GAF Membership status since the ranks were created. She was later appointed Staff and the Scribe for GAF.

            On the 18th June 2016 three new moderators were appointed: Tactical Bryan (maintaining his position) and Zidaref. However, after a group discussion, the decision to appoint a second admin along-side DiNitride was made - CynicalGrape was soon appointed. Meanwhile, on the 19th of June TiddleMonkey was appointed a GAF member - the second youngest member in the GAF roster so far.
