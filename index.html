                Welcome to The Never Ending GAF website, GAF is a bunch of idiots doing idiot related things together on the internet. Usually insulting each other in the process and generally not caring about much. This is our website, where you can find <em>completely useless</em> information all about us. 
                </p>
                
                <p>GAF is not recruiting in the sense that you can apply and join, we don't care, just come on Discord. We aren't a clan or formal group, just a bunch of mates who hang out together, play video games and bully each other.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I join the Official<sup>TM</sup> GAF Group?</h3>
                <p>
                Short answer: <b>No</b><br>
                Long answer: <b>No, fuck off</b><br>
                You can't 'join' GAF, there's no application page. We're a bunch of mates that play video games together. If you want to come and hang out with us, join the Discord server. Everyone who's ever been in GAF started there and that's how it will always be done.
                <br><br>
                However, don't be disapointed! You can stilll come and get insulted on our Discord server. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>A Brief History</h3>
                <p>
                Once upon a time, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of Janurary 2016, a bunch of idiots on the internet decided they would make a Steam group. Being the wonderful person he is, DiNitride did this, and became the dictator of GAF through no voting or fair deicion making at all. Some stuff happened between then and wherever we are now, and I don't care enough to explain, so that's it, that's the history you're getting. Some friends played video games, made a Steam group, and now a small little community has grown from it. 
                </p>
